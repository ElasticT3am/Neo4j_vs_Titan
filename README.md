# Neo4j_vs_Titan
This technical document constitutes a short report which has as main role to describe the difference (advantages and constitutes) between Neo4j and Titan graph databases/

# Distributed graph databases (Strong Points)
Like a fresh-team in distributed graph databases field wondering which databases is better for our project purposes. So, our team (Elastic TEAM) searched for a high-level perspective titan and neo4j may have.

The action points that elastic-team searched for a distributed database, are the following:

- Performance
- Scalability
- Backend Storage System
- Schema
- Indexing
- Search
- Modeling principles
- APIs

# Evaluation
Elastic TEAM is capable to demonstrate a status report with benchmarks and observations for our first Use Case - Indexing ASTs Java Projects in Distributed Graph Database. For more information about the kind of the Use Case, you can visit [ast-generator]() and [github-repo-parser]()
